# CKAN-API
This Google Apps Script automates dataset creation on a CKAN platform using data from a Google Sheet. It generates unique IDs, ensures the dataset name complies with CKAN rules, and handles errors. The script sends dataset details to CKAN via an API request and logs the process for easy debugging.
